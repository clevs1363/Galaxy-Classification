Many of the properties of galaxies (including the [galaxy color–magnitude diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_color%E2%80%93magnitude_diagram "Galaxy color–magnitude diagram")) indicate that there are fundamentally two types of galaxies. These groups divide into blue star-forming galaxies that are more like spiral types, and red non-star forming galaxies that are more like elliptical galaxies. However, there are different accepted classifications than a binary one.
# Elliptical

An **elliptical galaxy** is a type of [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") with an approximately [ellipsoidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid "Ellipsoid") shape and a smooth, nearly featureless image.
## Characteristics
Elliptical galaxies are characterized by several properties that make them distinct from other classes of galaxy. They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. Furthermore, there is very little [interstellar matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_matter "Interstellar matter") (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of [star formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation"), few [open star clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_cluster "Open cluster"), and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by [old stellar populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II "Population II"), giving them red colors. Most elliptical galaxies are composed of older, [low-mass stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution#Low-mass_stars "Stellar evolution").

Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster"). They generally have two distinct populations of globular clusters: one that is redder and metal-rich, and another that is bluer and metal-poor.

Every massive elliptical galaxy contains a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole) at its center. The mass of the black hole is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxy.

The [largest galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_galaxies "List of largest galaxies") are supergiant ellipticals, or [type-cD galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-cD_galaxy "Type-cD galaxy"). Elliptical galaxies vary greatly in both size and mass with diameters ranging from 3,000 [light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_year "Light year") to more than 700,000 light years, and masses from $10^5$ to nearly $10^{13}$ solar masses. This range is much broader for this galaxy type than for any other. Elliptical galaxies range from dwarf ellipticals with tens of millions of stars, to [supergiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-cD_galaxy "Type-cD galaxy") of over one hundred trillion [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") that dominate their galaxy clusters.

Astronomers now see elliptical galaxies as some of the most evolved systems in the universe. It is widely accepted that the main driving force for the evolution of elliptical galaxies is [mergers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_merger "Galaxy merger") of smaller galaxies.
# Spiral
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Messier_77_spiral_galaxy_by_HST.jpg)
Most spiral galaxies consist of a flat, rotating [disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_(galaxy) "Disc (galaxy)") containing [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), [gas and dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium"), and a central concentration of stars known as the [bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy) "Bulge (astronomy)"). These are often surrounded by a much fainter [halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_halo "Galactic halo") of stars, many of which reside in [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster"). 

Roughly two-thirds of all spirals are observed to have an additional component in the form of a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. The proportion of [barred spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy "Barred spiral galaxy") relative to [barless spirals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbarred_spiral_galaxy "Unbarred spiral galaxy") has likely changed over the history of the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe "Universe"), with only about 10% containing bars about 8 billion years ago, to roughly a quarter 2.5 billion years ago, until present, where over two-thirds of the [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") in the visible universe ([Hubble volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_volume "Hubble volume")) have bars.
## Structure
Spiral galaxies may consist of several distinct components:
- A flat, rotating [disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_galaxy "Disk galaxy") of stars and [interstellar matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium "Interstellar medium") of which spiral arms are prominent components
- A central stellar [bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy) "Bulge (astronomy)") of mainly older stars, which resembles an [elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy "Elliptical galaxy")
- A bar-shaped distribution of stars
- A near-spherical halo of stars, including many in [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_cluster "Globular cluster")
- A [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole") at the very middle of the central bulge
- A near-spherical [dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter "Dark matter") halo
### Spiral Arms
_Spiral arms_ are regions of stars that extend from the center of barred and [unbarred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbarred_spiral_galaxy "Unbarred spiral galaxy") spiral [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy"). The arms contain many young, blue stars (due to the high mass density and the high rate of star formation), which make the arms so bright.
### Bulge
A _bulge_ is a large, tightly packed group of stars, and can consist of old or young stars. The term refers to the central group of stars found in most spiral galaxies, often defined as the excess of stellar light above the inward extrapolation of the outer (exponential) disk light.

Some bulges have similar properties to those of elliptical galaxies (scaled down to lower mass and luminosity); others simply appear as higher density centers of disks, with properties similar to disk galaxies.

Many bulges are thought to host a [supermassive black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole "Supermassive black hole") at their centers.
### Bar
Bar-shaped elongations of stars are observed in roughly two-thirds of all spiral galaxies. Their presence may be either strong or weak.
### Spheroid
The bulk of the stars in a spiral galaxy are located either close to a single plane (the [galactic plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane "Galactic plane")) in more or less conventional circular [orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") around the center of the galaxy (the [Galactic Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center "Galactic Center")), or in a [spheroidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid "Spheroid") galactic bulge around the galactic core.

However, some stars inhabit a _spheroidal halo_ or _galactic spheroid_, a type of [galactic halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_halo "Galactic halo"). Unlike the galactic disc, the halo seems to be free of [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_dust "Interstellar dust"), and in further contrast, stars in the galactic halo are of [Population II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_II "Population II"), much older and with much lower [metallicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity "Metallicity") than their [Population I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_I "Population I") cousins in the galactic disc.

The motion of halo stars does bring them through the disc on occasion.
# Ring
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Hoag%27s_object.jpg)

A **ring galaxy** is a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") with a circle-like appearance. The ring contains many massive, relatively young blue [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star"), which are extremely bright. The central region contains relatively little luminous [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter "Matter"). 

Some [astronomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer "Astronomer") believe that ring galaxies are formed when a smaller galaxy passes through the center of a larger galaxy. Because most of a galaxy consists of empty space, this "collision" rarely results in any actual collisions between stars. However, the [gravitational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity") disruptions caused by such an event could cause a [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") of star formation to move through the larger galaxy. 

Other astronomers think that rings are formed around some galaxies when external [accretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics) "Accretion (astrophysics)") takes place. Star formation would then take place in the accreted material because of the shocks and compressions of the accreted material.

A third possibility is **bar instability**, a phenomenon where the rotational velocity of the bar in a [barred spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy "Barred spiral galaxy") increases to the point of spiral spin-out. When the bar is unstable, density waves are migrated out into a ring-structure by the pressure, force, and gravitational influence of the baryonic and dark matter furiously orbiting about the bar. This migration forces the stars, gas and dust found within the former arms into a torus-like region, forming a ring, and often igniting star formation.
# Lenticular
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Ngc5866_hst_big.png)

A **lenticular galaxy** is a [type of galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification "Galaxy morphological classification") intermediate between an [elliptical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy "Elliptical galaxy") and a [spiral galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy") in [galaxy morphological classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_morphological_classification "Galaxy morphological classification") schemes. It contains a large-scale disc but does not have large-scale spiral arms. Lenticular galaxies are [disc galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_galaxy "Disc galaxy") that have used up or lost most of their [interstellar matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_matter "Interstellar matter") and therefore have very little ongoing [star formation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation"). They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies).
## Morphology
Lenticular galaxies are unique in that they have a visible disk component as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar.

Lenticular galaxies are often considered to be a poorly understood transition state between spiral and elliptical galaxies, which results in their intermediate placement on the [Hubble sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence "Hubble sequence"). This results from lenticulars having both prominent disk and bulge components.

In addition to these general stellar attributes, [globular clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globular_clusters "Globular clusters") are found more frequently in lenticular galaxies than in spiral galaxies of similar mass and luminosity. They also have little to no molecular gas (hence the lack of star formation) and no significant hydrogen α or 21-cm emission. Finally, unlike ellipticals, they may still possess significant dust.
## Formation
The disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance of lenticular galaxies suggests they come from faded [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxies "Spiral galaxies"), whose arm features disappeared. However, some lenticular galaxies are more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they are not merely the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. 

Lenticular galaxies might result from a [galaxy merger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_merger "Galaxy merger"), which increase the total stellar mass and might give the newly merged galaxy a disk-like, arm-less appearance. 

Alternatively, it has been proposed that they grew their disks via (gas and minor merger) accretion events. It had previously been suggested that the evolution of luminous lenticular galaxies may be closely linked to that of elliptical galaxies, whereas fainter lenticulars might be more closely associated with ram-pressure stripped spiral galaxies.
# Irregular
An **irregular galaxy** is a [galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") that does not have a distinct regular shape, unlike a [spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy") or an [elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy "Elliptical galaxy"). Irregular galaxies do not fall into any of the regular classes of the [Hubble sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_sequence "Hubble sequence"), and they are often chaotic in appearance, with neither a [nuclear bulge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulge_(astronomy) "Bulge (astronomy)") nor any trace of [spiral arm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_arm "Spiral arm") structure

Collectively they are thought to make up about a quarter of all galaxies. Some irregular galaxies were once spiral or elliptical galaxies but were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. Irregular galaxies may contain abundant amounts of gas and dust. This is not necessarily true for dwarf irregulars.

Irregular galaxies are commonly small, about one tenth the mass of the Milky Way galaxy. Due to their small sizes, they are prone to environmental effects like [colliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_galaxy "Interacting galaxy") with large galaxies and intergalactic clouds.
